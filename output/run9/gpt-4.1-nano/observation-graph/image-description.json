The countertop extends across the lower part of the scenes, with a black cabinet underneath featuring vertical silver handles. Above, a matching black cabinet and a wooden vent hood are mounted on the wall. A small window with a wooden frame is also present, positioned near the stove area that contains a small saucepan.\n\nIn the dining area (second and third images), a wooden table with a light finish holds additional items including a large water bottle, a glass of wine, a pitcher, and various snack items such as a red box of shortbread, a box of rice bubbles, a Chucky album cover, and additional jars of jam. Surrounding the table are high-back, white upholstered chairs.\n\nThe environment has white textured walls and a brown hardwood floor, with the wall junctions and doorframes visible at the back. A door with a simple panel design and a brushed metal handle separates the kitchen from the dining area, visible in the third and fourth images. The ceiling is white with a circular ceiling light.",
