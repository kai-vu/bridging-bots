At the center is a small island with a stove top on one side. On it sits a small pot of coffee and some cups. To the right of the island, there's a refrigerator topped with a microwave and various food items. Above the refrigerator, there's an open cabinet with a box of cereal inside, suggesting that someone may have recently had breakfast or is preparing for it.\n\nThe kitchen is equipped with black cabinets on both sides, providing ample storage space. On one side, there is a sink and a faucet above it, next to which are several bottles of cleaning supplies, indicating that the area is frequently cleaned and maintained.\n\nThe flooring appears to be a light-colored laminate or vinyl plank, giving the kitchen an updated look. To the left of the island, there is a white countertop with various items placed on it, including a box of cereal and a tin can, possibly food or a beverage container.\n\nThe walls are painted in a light color, creating a bright and inviting atmosphere. On one wall, a small picture frame with a photograph of a child can be seen, adding a personal touch to the room. A whiteboard stands next to it on another part of the wall, perhaps for organizing groceries or meal planning.\n\nThe dining area is visible in the foreground, furnished with a table and four chairs around it, suggesting that this kitchen also serves as a dining space for meals. There's a window above the countertop, allowing natural light to enter the room during daytime hours. The overall layout of the kitchen suggests a functional and efficient use of space, accommodating both meal preparation and dining areas within the same footprint.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 1708, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"66f91eb2-acd0-4920-b536-1d7ec9e67eca": {"node_ids": ["f470486e-e1bf-415d-93f3-1e883a703726"], "metadata": {}}}}
