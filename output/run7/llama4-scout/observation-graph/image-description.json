The room has white walls and a brown wooden floor.\n\nIn the kitchen area, there are black cabinets with blue handles and a beige marble countertop. On the countertop, there is a sink, a pot on a stove, and a range hood above it. A window is also present. The items on the counter include a yellow cup, a red-and-white jar labeled \"Mrs. Murrary's Strawberry Jam,\" a blue-and-white box of Rice Bubbles cereal, a red box labeled \"CHUCKY\" with a picture of a doll on it, another red box of Jello, and a stack of white plates.\n\nAdjacent to the kitchen is a dining area with a brown wooden table and four white chairs. On the table, there is a bottle of Evian water, a plate with a mug and a spoon on it, a book titled \"Chocolate Cake Murder,\" and a bowl of fruit. \n\nA white refrigerator stands against the wall between the kitchen and dining areas. \n\nThe overall layout suggests a small, functional space for both food preparation and eating.",
