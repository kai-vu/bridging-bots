                "content": "A black‐cabinet kitchen lines two adjacent walls, forming an L‐shaped countertop of light‐colored marble. On the left stretch of counter, directly underneath a wooden‐framed window, sits a single sink with a faucet. In the corner to the right, a small cooktop holds a metal pot, and above it hangs a wooden‐trimmed range hood. Along the same countertop, near the cooktop, stand a mug, a red‐and‐yellow cereal box labeled “Chucky Haros,” another cereal box labeled “Rice Bubbles,” a jar of strawberry jam, a stack of white plates, a box of Jell‐O, and a container labeled “Alpen Salt.” A tall black pantry cabinet separates this workspace from a tall white refrigerator, which stands flush against a protruding wall.\n\nBeyond the fridge, the space opens into a dining area. Centered there is a rectangular wooden table surrounded by four white, high‐backed chairs. On the table sits a white bowl or caddy containing several oranges, with a large bottle of water (labeled “Evian”) positioned at or just in front of the fruit. Near them is a box of shortbread cookies, a clear glass pitcher, and one stemmed wine glass. A single door is set into the right‐hand wall behind the table, and overhead a round ceiling light illuminates the dining space. The entire floor is covered in parquet wood, running continuously through both the kitchen and dining areas.",
