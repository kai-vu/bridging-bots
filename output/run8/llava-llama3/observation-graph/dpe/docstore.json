On the left side of the image, there's a white countertop with a silver sink installed in it. The countertop appears to be clean and organized. There are two boxes on the countertop; one box has food items and the other seems to contain cooking or baking ingredients. To the right of the sink, we can see cabinets that have a dark finish, providing storage space.\n\nThe kitchen is equipped with black appliances such as an oven, which has a handle visible for opening it. The flooring appears to be made of wood, adding warmth to the room. On the countertop, there's a roll of paper towels and a white bottle that could contain cooking oil or another ingredient.\n\nIn the middle section of the image, there is an open refrigerator with its door slightly ajar. Inside the fridge, we can see items such as milk bottles and possibly some food or beverages. The refrigerator's light is turned off, suggesting it might be inactive mode or not currently in use.\n\nTo the right of the image, there's a dining table surrounded by chairs. On top of the table, there are two items - a red plastic bottle that might contain cooking oil and a stack of books or possibly some kind of recipe booklets, indicating meal planning or culinary interests.\n\nThe room has white walls and a ceiling light fixture above the countertop. The overall layout suggests a functional and well-maintained kitchen and dining space, ready for use but currently unoccupied.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 1497, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"c1590cf6-a20f-4ca1-9006-b6c6fb4820f8": {"node_ids": ["feb2320a-7067-4b9e-9a21-e0f75f6964d4"], "metadata": {}}}}
