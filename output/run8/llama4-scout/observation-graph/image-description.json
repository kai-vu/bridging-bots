Above the counter, there are more cabinets and a vent hood. On the counter, there are various items, including a jar of jam, a box of Jello, a box of Alpen Salt, a box of Rice Bubbles, another jar of jam, a box of shortbread cookies, and a stack of plates. To the right of the kitchen, there is a white refrigerator against the wall.\n\nIn the dining area, there is a wooden table with four white chairs around it. On the table, there are two bottles of water, one of which is a milk bottle, a cookbook, and a puzzle box. The walls are white, and the floor is made of dark wood parquet tiles. The overall layout suggests a small, functional space for both food preparation and eating.",
